<h2> What is Pollution? </h2>
  <p>The introduction of hazardous elements into the environment is pollution. Pollutants are the name for these dangerous substances (eg smoke,emmisson, waste and oil.) Natural pollutants like volcanic ash are not acceptable. They can also be brought by by human activity, such as factory runoff or waste. The quality of the air, water, and land is harmed by pollution. </p>


<h2> What are the different types of Pollutions</h2>
  <p> There are many types of pollutions but in this website the main four (4) would be foucused on. Such as: </p>
  <li> Land Pollution </li>
  <li> Noise Pollution </li>
<li> Air Pollution </li>
<li> Water Pollution </li>

  <h2> LAND POLLUTION</h2>

  <P> What is Land Pollution? </P>When we improperly dispose of waste, it usually results in land pollution. Deposition of liquid or solid waste on the surface of the earth or below it is also referred to as land pollution. Subsequently, the substance contaminates the groundwater or soil. Public health is also under danger. You may wonder what you as an individual can do to prevent land pollution. Here are some ways: 1.Do not litter 2.Encourage others to avoid littering  3.Volunteering to help clean polluted areas. Land pollution is prevalant in the caribbean because it does not have a proper infrastructure disposal of garbage/waste. The effects of land pollutions are </P>
  <li> Flooding</li>
<li> Foul smells</li>
<li> Excess migration rodents and insects (which leads to bacteria) </li>

    <p> What is Air Pollution? </p> <p> When specific gases, droplets, or particles mix with the surrounding air to create air pollution, the air becomes unhealthy for all living creatures. There are numerous types of air pollution that come from numerous sources and cause a wide range of issues for humans, other animals, plants, and the environment. Volcanoes, dust storms, methane gas and radon gas from subterranean radium deposits are other typical natural sources of air pollution in addition to wildfires. These are unusual. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and natural gas), which can take different forms and emit a range of pollutants, is a source of air pollution that is caused by humans.Utilizing public transit and carpooling can help people reduce the quantity of fuel they burn for transportation, hence reducing the amount of pollutants they release into the air and contributing to reduced air pollution. These choices are affordable and can contribute to cost savings. Avoid smoking and burning trash; burning trash contributes significantly to air pollution. Smoking cigarettes is another factor in air pollution. Air pollution can be greatly reduced by avoiding certain activities and raising public awareness of their harmful effects. Air Pollution can lead to long term health effects such as: </p>
  <li> Heart disease</li>
  <li> Lung cancer </li>
  <h2> WATER POLLUTION</h2>

  <p> What is Water Pollution?
    When dangerous substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, the water's quality deteriorates and it becomes toxic for both humans and the environment. Water pollution results from human activities that produce hazardous waste and domestic sewage, which contaminate water with pathogenic microbes and dangerous compounds. Another cause of water pollution that has a terrible effect on the ecosystems in the area is oil spills. In the Caribbean the oceans are one of many beautiful sceneries who would want to visit a country with polluted waters? No one! This is why we should avert dumping directly into water systems. We can also clean our drains to avoid anymore waste to be passed out and reuse and recycle.</p>
